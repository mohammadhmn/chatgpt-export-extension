ChatGPT Chat Exporter is a browser extension that helps you export chats from the ChatGPT website into JSON files.

## Data collection

- The extension does **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share your data.
- The extension does **not** send your chat content to any server.
- The extension does **not** use analytics, tracking, or remote logging.

## How your data is processed

- Chat data is read **only** from the currently open ChatGPT web page in your browser.
- Exported data is saved **locally** as JSON downloads initiated in your browser.
- Optional settings (delay/limits) are stored using Chrome’s built-in extension storage (`chrome.storage`) on your device.

- Host permissions (`chatgpt.com`, `chat.openai.com`): used to limit where the exporter can run.
